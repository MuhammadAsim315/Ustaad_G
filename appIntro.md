# Ustad G – Service Provider App

> **Current Status: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**  
> This document outlines both MVP features (currently in development) and future enhancements.

## 1. Introduction

**Ustad G** is a service provider marketplace mobile application that connects users with skilled workers such as electricians, plumbers, cleaners, and other household service professionals. The app allows users to book services, make in-app payments, and track job progress, while service providers receive job requests and get paid through the platform.

Ustad G operates on a **commission-based model**, where a percentage of each completed job payment is retained by the platform.
